## Course Description

This course introduces the theory and application of machine learning, sometimes referred to as artificial intelligence. Students who take this course will understand and be able to deploy basic supervised and unsupervised learning techniques including” decision trees, neural networks, kernel methods, support vector machines, and probabilistic methods. The course will be taught using Python, R, Matlab, or a similar programming language.

## Prerequisites

Math 3080 and (either Math 2270 or Math 2250) with a C or better in each course. Some familiarity with a program language including a basic understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Textbook

We will use a variety of resources throughout the course:

* *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*, 3rd Edition, Aurelien Geron, 2022.
  * Available on O'Reilly website (see below)

1. __Homework__ will be assigned occasionally throughout the course to give practice in Machine Learning techniques.
2. __Projects__ will be assigned to challenge the student and to check the student's understanding of the material.
3. A __Midterm Exam__ will be given before Spring Break. It will cover material from the beginning of the semester to that point to test application of techniques discussed.
4. A __Final Exam__ will cover some questions regarding what has been learned during the semester, as well as opportunities to demonstrate techniques learned through the semester.
