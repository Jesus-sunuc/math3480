# Types of Machine Learning
Machine Learning can be categorized in many ways. First, let's look at how the models are trained.
1. Supervised Learning
  * __Categorization__ (Discrete Data)
  * __Regression__ (Continuous Data)
  * Important supervised learning algorithms
    * k-Nearest Neighbors
    * Linear Regression
    * Logistic Regression
    * Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
    * Decision Trees and Random Forests
    * Neural Networks
2. Unsupervised Learning
  * __Clustering__ (Discrete Data)
  * __Dimensionality Reduction__ (aka. __Feature Extraction__) (Continuous Data)
  * *Data Mining* fits in the Unsupervised Learning category
  * Important unsupervised learning algorithms
    * Clustering
      * K-Means
      * DBSCAN
      * Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
    * Anomaly detection and novelty detection
      * One-class SVM
      * Isolation Forest
    * Visualization and Dimensionality Reduction
      * Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
      * Kernel PCA
      * Locally-Linear Embedding (LLE)
      * t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
    * Association rule learning
      * Apriori
      * Eclat
3. Semisupervised Learning

4. Reinforced Learning
