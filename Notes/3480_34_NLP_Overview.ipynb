    "When we speak, we share thoughts in *Unstructured* language.\n",
    "> Add eggs and milk to my shopping list\n",

    "    * Remove unimportant words that do not add much to the meaning\n",
    "    * \"a\", \"and\", \"the\"\n",
    "4. Stemming\n",
    "    * Some words are different, but have the same root\n",
    "    * \"swim\", \"swims\", \"swimming\", \"swam\"\n",
    "5. Lemmatization\n",
    "    * Find generalization of each stemmed word\n",
    "    * [\"Am\", \"Are\", \"Is\"] come from the same verb: \"Be\"\n",
    "6. Speech Tagging\n",
    "    * Where is each token used in a sentence?\n",
    "    * Label each word as Noun, Verb, Preposition, etc.\n",
    "7. Named Entity Tagging or Named Entity Recognition\n",
    "    * Flagging names of locations, movies, people, etc. that may occur in the document\n",
    "    * Is there an entity associated with a particular token?\n",
