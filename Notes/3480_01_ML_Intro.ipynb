    "Machine Learning: Build models from the data. The models also improve as data is added to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? In the world, we often have equations that explain what will happen (physics and chemistry, for example). There is a function that takes $x$ to $y$. These equations come after others have seen patterns in the data and can find equations that describe the real world. But most often, our data doesn't have equations. So, our job is to see the patterns in the data.\n",
