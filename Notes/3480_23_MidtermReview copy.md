## Details
* Two parts:
  1. In-class portion: during class on Monday, March 18
  2. Programming portion: 
    * Opens after class (2:30pm on Monday, March 18)
    * Due 24 hours later (2:30pm on Tuesday, March 19)

## Overview
* Machine Learning Process
* Data Handling
    * Loading, cleaning, and wrangling data
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    * Graphing
    * Statistical calculation (mean, median, quartiles, correlations, ...)
    * Purpose is to extract additional information
    * The user gets familiar with the data
* Types of Data/Machine Learning
    * Supervised/Unsupervised/Semi-supervised
        * Classification: Discrete Supervised models
        * Regression: Continuous Supervised models
        * Clustering: Discrete Unsupervised models
        * Dimensionality Reduction/Embedding/...: Continuous Unsupervised models
    * Instance-based vs. model-based
    * Online/Batch(Offline) learning
* Preprocessing
    * Missing values
    * Anomalies
    * Scaling (Standardize/Normalize)
    * One-hot encoding (dummy variables)
    * Ordinal encoding
    * Remove extra (irrelevant) variables
    * Cross validation (split data into training and testing datasets)
